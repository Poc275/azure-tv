When Ferrino arrives he is quick to mock The Good Guys efforts and much to Beach's anger proceeds to take over. He sets up an exchange with Smiler McCarthy of $500,000 for £2,000,000 of counterfeit money. He has placed the money in a bag, which is rigged with aluminium dye, which will explode over Smiler as soon as he opens the bag thereby marking him and pinning this job on him (thus creating grounds for an arrest).\n\nThe plan backfires when Mark Kemp decides he wants to see half a million dollars as he'll never get the chance again. He opens the bag and covers all the Good Guys (apart from Beach who is in his office telling Ferrino that they are the best in the force). They are forced to use new tactics. They send Gary Barwick rigged with a camera into a pub to meet one of Smiler's men to find out when McCarthy will be taking the fake money. Instead Gary gets drunk and",

The series followed the titular Alan Partridge, a failed television presenter whose previous exploits had featured in the chat-show parody Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, and who is now presenting a programme on local radio in Norwich.\n\nBoth series were written by Peter Baynham, Coogan and Armando Iannucci; supporting Coogan were Felicity Montagu as his faithful, mouse-like personal assistant, Lynn Benfield; Simon Greenall as Geordie Travel Tavern handyman/BP garage attendant Michael; and Phil Cornwell as disc jockey Dave Clifton.\n\nIt has been well received by both critics and fans, and was nominated for three BAFTAs, two British Comedy Award, and a Royal Television Society award.",

        "overview": "Catterick, aka Vic and Bob in Catterick, is a surreal 2004 BBC situation comedy in 6 episodes, written by and starring Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, with Reece Shearsmith, Matt Lucas, Morwenna Banks, Tim Healy, Mark Benton and Charlie Higson. The series was originally broadcast on BBC Three and later rerun on BBC2. Reeves has said that the BBC do not want another series of Catterick, though he may produce a spin-off centring on the DI Fowler character.\n\nCatterick is arguably Vic and Bob's darkest and most bizarre programme to date, balancing their typically odd, idiosyncratic comedy with some genuinely dark scenes. It plays like a darkly comic road movie, albeit full of Vic and Bob's bizarre, often inscrutable and frequently silly humour. Catterick is probably Vic and Bob's most uncompromising show since their notorious and frequently baffling 1999 sketch series Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, from which most of the characters are taken. It is in some ways stylistically similar to their short film The Weekenders first broadcast in 1992 on British television as part of Channel 4's \"Bunch of Five\" series.\n\nThe series is named after Catterick in North Yorkshire, Britain's largest army base. It is about 10 miles away from Darlington where Vic Reeves grew up. It is also about 20 miles away from Middlesbrough where Bob Mortimer grew up.",

On the Hour was written by Morris, Iannucci, Steven Wells, Andrew Glover, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring, David Quantick, and the cast. For The Day Today, Peter Baynham joined the writing team, and Lee and Herring were replaced by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews. The principal cast of On the Hour was retained for The Day Today.\n\nThe Day Today is composed of six half-hour episodes and a selection of shorter, five-minute slots recorded as promotion trailers for the longer segments. The six half-hour episodes were originally broadcast from 19 January to 23 February 1994 on BBC2. The Day Today has won many awards, including Morris winning the 1994 British Comedy Award for Best Newcomer. All six episodes are available on BBC DVD, having previously been issued on VHS.",

His healing hands wow the customers, until an old man asks if he can do any \"\"extras\"\". Word spreads and the salon is packed with the men of Royston Vasey, blissfully unaware they are being wanked off by Charlie. When Tony comes for one of the \"\"special massages\"\", Charlie becomes obsessed with him and falls in love with him, eventually telling Tony he's the masseur with the magic hands. Tony is disgusted and the shit hits the fan: Stella wins big on the fruit machines and jets off overseas, and Judee sacks him.",

Howard takes an acting lesson with aged actor Montgomery Flange, in order to cure him of the Chokes; an intense form of stage fright, and to outdo Sammy the Crab in a bid to impress director Jurgen Haabermaaster, who is in the audience on the night at The Velvet Onion. Sammy the Crab proceeds to run amok, after having alcohol and food poured into his tank by the Black Tubes, killing several support acts. Vince phones Howard, who stuns everyone - including Jurgen - with his impressive acting. Vince eventually gets his drainpipes on, at the price of having an exaggeratedly large head, causing him to fall over and thus ruining the gig. It later transpires that Sammy The Crab has replaced him as the frontman of The Black Tubes. Howard returns from working with Jurgen Haabermaaster, dissatisfied with the work he was offered (playing the Angry Crab Of Trapped Wind in a trapped wind commercial), much to the amusement of Naboo, Bollo and Vince.",

The Mighty Boosh is a comic fantasy containing humour and pop-culture references. Episodes often featured elaborate musical numbers in different genres, such as electro, heavy metal, funk, and rap. The show has been known for popularising a style called \"crimping\"; short a cappella songs which are present throughout all three series. Julian Barratt wrote the music within the show, and performs it with Noel Fielding. Fielding also designed many of the show's graphics and artwork.\n\nThe TV series has many animated sequences, puppets and special effects. Barratt has said that he approached Fielding with the idea of doing a show like The Goodies, as if it were a complete \"world\" rather than simply a sketch show. Barratt and Fielding play many of the recurring and one-off characters themselves, with other characters being played by other Boosh members Rich Fulcher, Dave Brown, and Michael Fielding.",

Meanwhile, Howard is captured and brainwashed by the Yeti. Vince, Naboo, and Bollo set out to save Howard, and also end up brainwashed by the Yeti. As they are all about to be raped, they are saved by Kodiak Jack, who is then instead raped.

To inspire them, Naboo tells them the story of Rudy van Disarzio and Spider Dijon; the Bongo Brothers, who form the band Rudi & Spider. Rudi and Spider wander the desert in search of inspiration; looking for the New Sound. After an argument, Spider leaves with the intention of drumming for Carlos Santana, becoming temporarily distracted by a town populated only by women. Rudi soon happens upon the town, meeting and bonding with an inhabitant of the town called Monkey, who tells him of a bandit called Betamax, who regularly terrorises the town. Rudi and Spider reconvene, the latter then earns himself a Door of Cuckundu by refusing tickets to Santana in Rio from Rudi, and together go to face Betamax. Spider eventually defeats him by rewinding him with his Door of Cuckundu. Rudi & Spider then showcase their newly found sound; found inside their own minds. This is of no help to Howard and Vince, whom Naboo gives Lucozade, telling them it is a magic potion to help their performance.",

After hearing from Bollo about the Fountain of Youth on Naboo's home planet Xooberon, Howard and Vince steal his amulet and travel there, where they wander the Desert of Nightmares and meet the Xooberon Tribe. Back at the flat, Naboo finds out about Howard and Vince stealing his amulet, and is annoyed that he has to save them. The Xooberon Tribe notice Vince has the amulet and make him their leader, and Howard his slave. Meanwhile, The Hitcher overviews these events, planning to steal the amulet for himself. Vince's status as the Chosen One is tested when a beast named Sandstorm threatens the Xooberon Tribe; Vince befriends him by gifting him with gloves which he uses to masturbate. Howard is tricked into stealing the amulet by The Hitcher, who knocks Howard out and leaves. He awakens with Vince, buried up to their necks in sand; a punishment from the Xooberon Tribe for loosing the amulet. Naboo and Bollo arrive, and accompany Vince and Howard to the Fountain of Youth, hindered by an evil tree; whom Vince summons Sandstorm to disposes of. Naboo then flushes the toilet of the Fountain of Youth, liquefying The Hitcher. The King who first gave Naboo the amulet and sent him to earth arrives and congratulates Naboo. On the way back to earth, Howard and Vince consume Youth Juice, which reverts them to babies.",

Due to Howard's fear of flying, they travel by boat, but are thrown overboard and stranded on a desert island for Vince's giving the captain a haircut whilst he slept. Howard's condition quickly deteriorates due to lack of nourishment, so they decide to eat coconuts. Howard begins keeping a journal, and Vince fashions bamboo drainpipes. Howard and Vince begin arguing, and separate to build huts: Vince's elaborate and complicated, compared to Howard's board on a stick. Howard fashions a male companion out of a coconut, calling it Milky Joe. Howard eventually builds a proper hut with the help of Milky Joe. Vince then fashions a female companion out of a coconut called Ruby. This makes Howard jealous, who fashions a wig for Milky Joe and temporarily calls her Jemima. Howard then sings a song about isolation. Vince then fashions another female companion out of a coconut called Precious Lilywhite. This agitates Howard further; he eventually persuades Vince to invite him to dinner with Precious and Ruby. Howard eventually ends up with Precious who turns out to be physically abusive. While Vince has a party on the beach, Howard accidentally kills Precious. The coconuts begin moving of their own accord; coconut police begin chasing them, they are caught and sent to coconut court, where they are found guilty of murder, and used as attractions in a coconut shie. At this point, Howard and Vince are splashed with water by a sailor, which awakens them from their rancid coconut-induced nightmare. They return home to watch the televised version of the Pie Face Showcase; headlined by Milky Joe and the Coconuts.",

It transpires that \"Voodoo Scat\" was made with a drop of Howlin' Jimmy Jefferson's blood, infecting Vince's blood stream with a corruptive rogue Jazz cell, causing him to embarrass his bandmates by scat singing at their gig in the Velvet Onion, which causes a riot. Vince is rushed back to the Nabootique, delirious, as the Jazz cell begins killing his cells. To save him, Naboo shrinks Howard and his blind friend Lester Corncrake down to microscopic size and injects them into Vince’s body to kill the invasive cell. Howard eventually succeeds in reaching the brain, where the Jazz cell begins to chase him. Howard and Lester catch it, and regrow to normal size. The Jazz cell is now also normal size, but is defeated by Lester, whom stabs him with Sid Vicious' safety pin, causing him to run away crying.",

Howard quickly abandons this philosophy when he has his style stolen by Lance Dior's partner, Harold Boom, who together become The Flighty Zeus. As The Flighty Zeus become increasingly more popular, The Mighty Boosh become increasingly dejected, feeling the Zeus are always one step ahead of them. The Boosh almost give up, before having the idea of premiering their music invention, crimping, at a gig at The Velvet Onion. They arrive to find The Flighty Zeus plagiarising an earlier crimp of theirs. The Boosh challenge the Zeus to a crimp-off, eventually winning by way of a four-way crimp, involving Howard, Vince, Naboo, and Bollo. This is only the episode to date where a character has referred to Vince and Howard as \"The Boosh.\" After their performance at the Velvet Onion, Bob Fossil states \"The Boosh have really lost it.\"",

Howard takes an acting lesson with aged actor Montgomery Flange, in order to cure him of the Chokes; an intense form of stage fright, and to outdo Sammy the Crab in a bid to impress director Jurgen Haabermaaster, who is in the audience on the night at The Velvet Onion. Sammy the Crab proceeds to run amok, after having alcohol and food poured into his tank by the Black Tubes, killing several support acts. Vince phones Howard, who stuns everyone - including Jurgen - with his impressive acting. Vince eventually gets his drainpipes on, at the price of having an exaggeratedly large head, causing him to fall over and thus ruining the gig. It later transpires that Sammy The Crab has replaced him as the frontman of The Black Tubes. Howard returns from working with Jurgen Haabermaaster, dissatisfied with the work he was offered (playing the Angry Crab Of Trapped Wind in a trapped wind commercial), much to the amusement of Naboo, Bollo and Vince.",
